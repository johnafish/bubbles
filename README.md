## To Use
Clone repo, open index.html, generate bubbles.

## Why?
Had a vision, thought it looked cool, maybe you also think it looks cool.

## How?
Bubbles are circles that fall down until they can fall down no more. The algorithm for doing this sucks. The right way to do it involves physics and I didn't do it the right way. This is close enough to look cool.
